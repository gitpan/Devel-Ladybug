INSTALLATION

  Ease of installation is one of Devel::Ladybug’s goals. The only build
  requirements are a compiler ("gcc" or equivalent is needed by CPAN to
  build a few dependencies), and a working Perl 5 (5.8.8 or greater).
  Devel::Ladybug’s prerequisite Perl packages are handled by CPAN, and
  generally install with no fuss. These are listed in Makefile.PL.

FROM CPAN (RECOMMENDED)

  The recommended way to install Devel::Ladybug is via CPAN:

  perl −MCPAN −e 'install Devel::Ladybug'

  Answer "yes" when prompted to install dependencies. You must (of
  course) have permission on your local system to do so, which means you
  either have superuser access, or your user owns the Perl install.

  Devel::Ladybug does not depend on any particular DBI driver‐‐ the
  package of your choice needs to be installed separately in order to be
  usable by Devel::Ladybug as a backing store type. Currently supported
  drivers are: DBD::mysql, DBD::Pg, and DBD::SQLite.

FROM SOURCE

  Assuming dependencies have been installed, installation may also be
  done manually:

    cd Devel−Ladybug−xxxx
    perl Makefile.PL # Warns if system is missing prereqs
    make test
    make install

INSTALL PROBLEMS?

  The most common installation problem is due to a compiler not being
  present on the local machine. After installing gcc, you may need to
  purge the contents of the CPAN build directory to avoid cached failed
  build results (e.g. ~root/.cpan/build/*), and re‐run the installation.

  Refer to recent CPAN Testers results to see if Devel::Ladybug "should"
  work with your particular software stack. Installation problems may be
  reported to the author via email (please include the output from "make
  test")
